:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.
:::

When [curators](@) generate an [HRG](@) from a particular [MRG](@), they may want to specify the [terms](@) to be included in the [HRG](@) (or preventing specific [MRG entries](@) from being included).

This can be done by using the same mechanism for [terminology construction](/docs/tev2/spec-tools/terminology-construction) as is used for generating [MRGs](@). The differences are that there is only one source, i.e. the particular [MRG](@) from which the [HRG](@) is generated. Thus, references to [terms](@) that have no corresponding [MRG entry](@) in that [MRG](@) are invalid. Also, there is no need for renaming syntax.



If generating an [HRG](@) requires the selection of terms, the instructions are to be specified in the `termselcrit` field of the configuration file specified as an argument on the command-line when calling the [HRGT](@).

## Adding terms {#syntax-add}

The following instructions can be used for adding [terms](@) (whitespace in the syntax is disregarded):

| Instruction                | The instruction adds every [MRG entry](@) from the [MRG](@) to the [terminology under construction](@) ... |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `terms [ <termslist> ]`    | whose `term`-field is an element of `<termslist>`. |
| `tags  [ <grouptagslist> ]`| whose `groupTags` field contains an element that is also an element of `<grouptagslist>`. |
| `*`                        | that exists within the [MRG](@) from which the [HRG](@) is generated. |

Notes:
- `<termslist>` and `<grouptagslist>` are comma-separated lists of [terms](@) and [grouptags](@) respectively.
- An [MRG entry](@) will only be added to the [terminology under construction](@) if it does not already exist.

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>

| Instruction | What it does when processed |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| `terms[party]` | finds the [MRG entry](@) associated with the [term](@) `party`, and adds it to the selected set of [terms](@). |
| `tags[management,governance]` | finds the [MRG entries](@) associated with the [terms](@) `management` and `governance`, and adds them to the selected set of [terms](@). |
| `*` | selects all [terms](@) from the [MRG](@), and adds them to the selected set of [terms](@). |

</details>

## Removing terms {#syntax-remove}

The following instructions can be used for removing [terms](@) from the set of selected [terms](@) (whitespace in the syntax is disregarded):

| Instruction   | The instruction removes every [MRG entry](@) from the [terminology under construction](@) ... |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-terms [ <termslist> ]` | whose `term`-field is an element of `<termslist>`. |
| `-tags  [ <grouptagslist> ]` | whose `groupTags` field contains an element that is also an element of `<groutagslist>`. |

Notes:
- `<termslist>` and `<grouptagslist>` are comma-separated lists of [terms](@), and [grouptags](@) respectively.
- Elements of the `<termslist>` or `<grouptagslist>` that do not lead to the removal of an [MRG entry](@) may be logged.

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>

| Instruction | What it does when processed |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| `-terms[party, actor]` | removes the [MRG entries](@) that have either `party` or `actor` in its `term` field. |
| `-tags[management]` | removes all [MRG entries](@) that have a [grouptag](@) `management`.  |
