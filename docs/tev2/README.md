# Contributing to TEv2 Tools

:::info Editor's note
This documentation is based on the [ToIP TT-Tools Proposal](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/tev2/toip-terminology-toolbox) memo, which we currently keep as a reference.
:::

The '[Terminology Engine v2 (TEv2)](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/tev2/tev2-overview)' consists of two parts:
1. The [Terminology Toolbox](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/tev2/tev2-toolbox) is a set of (extendable) command-line tools that can be used for generic purposes, such as resolving [term-references](term-ref@), and creating glossaries.
2. The use of these, and other tools (in our case: [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and [github CI/CD](https://resources.github.com/ci-cd/)), for facilitating the [curation](curate@) of [terminologies](terminology@) by [terms communities](terms-community).

We are seeking parties that can contribute to the development of these (extendable) command-line tools, and do so in close collaboration with the eSSIF-Lab consortium. Please express your interest as an [issue in the eSSIF-Lab repo](https://github.com/essif-lab/framework/issues).
