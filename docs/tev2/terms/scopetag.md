# Scopetag

:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.

### Summary
A **Scopetag** is a [tag](@) that is used to [identify](@) [scopes](@), e.g. in [term refs](@).

Scopetags [identify](@) a [scope](@) (from within a given [scope](@)), and hence can be used (within that given [scope](@)) to disambiguate [terms](@).

The [terminology pattern](pattern-terminology@) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

### Criteria
A **Scopetag** (of/within a [scope](@)) is a [tag](@) that is used within that [scope](@) to [identify](@) itself or other [scopes](@). It satisfies the regex `[a-z0-9_-]+`.

### Examples
Examples of scopetags are `essif-lab`, `essiflab`, `toip`, or `ctwg`.

### Notes
Discussions about which regex a tag should satisfy must be held with care. For example, one might argue that allowing the `.` character for [versiontags](@) might be beneficial. However, allowing a `.` character in a [scopetag](@) may cause problems with (the alternative syntax) of [term refs](@), as email address in square brackets might then qualify as a [term ref](@) while that is very likely not the [author](@)'s intention.
