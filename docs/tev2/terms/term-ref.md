# Term Ref

:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.

### Summary
A **Term Ref** is a word or phrase that is [marked up (in a specific way)](/docs/tev2/spec-syntax/term-ref-syntax) so that it refers to a particular [concept](@) (or other [knowledge artifact](@)), enabling it to be rendered in a variety of ways for the purpose of helping [readers](@) to (better) understand the intention of its [author](@).

A [term ref](@) consists of two parts. The first part is the word or phrase that is marked up (the so-called `show text`). The second part is the actual reference that specifies the [concept](@) (or other [knowledge artifact](@)) to which the [term ref](@) refers. This second part is called a [term identifier](@).

[Authors](@) need to know the [term ref syntax](/docs/tev2/spec-syntax/term-ref-syntax) that they are expected to use.

[Curators](@), which are expected to control the ways in which authored texts are further processed (into rendered texts), will need to know the options provided by the [TRRT tool](/docs/tev2/spec-tools/trrt) in order to ensure that the [term refs](@) that are used in in authored text are rendered in the way(s) that are envisaged.

### Purpose
[Term refs](@) make it easy for [authors](@) to associate some word(s) or phrase(s) with a specific [knowledge artifact](@), c.q. the [curated text](@) that (authoritatively) documents it. Also, [term refs](@) enable authored texts to be rendered in various ways, each of which is capable of converting such [term refs](@) into effects that help [readers](@) to (better) understand what the [author(s)](@) of the text intended when using a [term](@) or phrase.
