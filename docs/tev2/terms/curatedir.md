# Curatedir

:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.

### Summary
A **Curatedir** is a directory within a [scopedir](@) within which every file contains a [curated texts](@) for that [scope](@).

The [curatedir](@) may contain subdirectories to organize the various kinds of [curated texts](@).

The location of the [curatedir](@) of a [scope](@) is specified in the [SAF](@) of that [scope](@) (which is located in the root of the [scopedir](@)).
