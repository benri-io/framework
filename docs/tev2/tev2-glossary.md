# TEv2 - Glossary and Mental Models

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.
:::

[TEv2](@) 'eats its own dogfood' by documenting the [knowledge artifacts](@) that it uses, and using the tools in the [TEv2 toolbox](/docs/tev2/tev2-toolbox) as they become available.

The current [knowledge artefacts](@) consist of
- a [mental model](@), called [Terminology Support](/docs/tev2/terms/patterns/pattern-terminology) (or [Self-Sovereign Terminology](/docs/tev2/terms/patterns/pattern-terminology)).
- a set of [terms](@) that can be found by opening the `TEv2 Glossary` item in the sidebar
