# Terminology Engine v2 - Overview

:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.
:::

The Terminology Engine (v2) is a set of specifications and tools that caters for the creation and maintenance (i.e. [curation](@)) of [terminologies](@), as well as for its subsequent use in publications of different types (e.g. websites, whitepapers) and formats (e.g. html, LaTeX), as appropriate for different, individual [scopes](@).

The following perspectives are meant to help you get an overview of [TEv2](@) and its intended impact:
- **[Understanding One Another](/docs/tev2/overview/tev2-common-understanding)** is what it ultimately is all about. This perspective describes our take on this.
- **[Purpose](/docs/tev2/overview/tev2-purpose)**. This perspective states the objectives that we seek to realize with [TEv2](@).
- **[Design Principles](/docs/tev2/overview/tev2-design-principles)**. This perspective describes the main ideas behind the ways in which [TEv2](@) has been designed.
- **[Architecture](/docs/tev2/overview/tev2-architecture)**. This perspective provides an overview of the files, tools and how they interrelate.
- **[Terminology Support](/docs/tev2/terms/patterns/pattern-terminology)**. This perspective describes the mental model we use to think about what we're doing.
