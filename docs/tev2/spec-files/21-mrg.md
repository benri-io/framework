# Machine Readable Glossary (MRG)

:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.
:::

Every [scope](@) has (at least) one **Machine Readable Inventory**[^1] (that we call a **Machine Readable Glossary** or [MRG](@)), that renders the [terminology](@) of a specific [scope](@) into a specific, well-defined format that is described in this document. An [MRG](@) is meant to be used by the tools from the [toolbox](/docs/tev2/tev2-toolbox), e.g. for creating a [HRG](@), or to help resolve [term refs](@). A [scope](@) may have multiple [MRGs](@), each of which represents a specific version of its [terminology](@).

[^1]: The [MRG](@) is an Inventory rather than a [glossary](@), because it contains _all_ [knowledge artifacts](@) that are [curated](@) within the [scope](@): apart from [terms](@), it also include e.g., [mental models](pattern@) and [use cases](@). We choose to maintain the [term](@) "Machine Readable Glossary" ([MRG](@)), because most of us would view it - initially, at least - as a list of [terms](@) and their [definitions](@).

We use `mrg.<vsntag>.yaml` as the default name for [MRGs](@), where `<vsntag>` is the value of the `vsntag`-field in the `versions` section of the [SAF](@) that specifies the [MRG's](@) contents.

:::info Editor's note:
We may need to revise the [MRG](@)-file naming conventions.

## MRG structure

A Machine Readable Glossary (MRG) is a YAML (or JSON) file that has three sections:
- **`terminology`** specifies the characteristics of the [terminology](@) of the [scope](@). This includes the [scopetag](@) and [scopedir](@) of the [scope](@), as well as the license under which the contents of the [MRG](@) can be used.
- **`scopes`** specifies which (other) [scopes](@) are relevant to this [terminology](@). This includes the [scopetag](@) and [scopedir](@) of any such [scope](@).
- **`entries`** contains an (unsorted) list of [MRG entries](@).

### MRG `Terminology` section {#mrg-terminology}

The following fields are defined for the sections `terminology`:

<details>
  <summary>Legend</summary>

1. **`Name`** contains the field name;
2. **`Req'd`** specifies whether (`Y`, or `Y*`) or not (`n`, or `F`) the field is required to be present as a header field. The `Y*` signifies that currently, the field is required, but that we envisage it to become optional when tooling becomes more mature, and will be able to automatically create the specified default value. The `F` means that we reserve this field for Future Use.
3. **`Description`** specifies the meaning of the field, and other things you may need to know, e.g. why it is needed, a required syntax, etc.

</details>

| Name       | Req'd | Description |
| ---------- | :---: | :---------- |
| `scopetag`   | Y | [Scopetag](@) of the [scope](@) in which the [MRG](@) is defined. This is the [scopetag](@) that the [curators](@) of the [scope](@) have chosen for this [scope](@).<br/>Must satisfy regex `[a-z0-9_-]+`. |
| `scopedir`   | Y | URL that locates the [scope directory](@) associated with that [scope](@). |
| `curatedir`  | Y | Path to the directory where all [curated files](@) are located. This directory may contain subdirectories to allow [curators](@) to organize the files in any way they see fit. Full URL is `<scopedir>`/`<curatedir>`.|
| `vsntag`     | Y | [versiontag](@) by which the [terminology](@) of this [MRG](@) can be distinguished from the other versions of the [terminology](@) (in other [MRGs](@)). Its value MUST match the `vsntag` field of the corresponding `versions` section in the [SAF](@) |
| `altvsntags` | n | List of alternative [versiontags](@) that can be used to [identify](@) this version. Each of the values MUST be in the list of [versiontags](@) in the `altvsntags` field of the the corresponding `versions` section in the [SAF](@). |
| `license`    | n | File that contains the (default) licensing conditions. Full URL is `scopedir`/`license`. Its value MUST match the `license` field of the corresponding `versions` section in the [SAF](@), or if that isn't specified, the `license` field of the `scope` section in the [SAF](@). |

### MRG `scopes` section {#mrg-scopes}

The following fields are defined for the section `scopes`:

<details>
  <summary>Legend</summary>

1. **`Name`** contains the field name;
2. **`Req'd`** specifies whether (`Y`, or `Y*`) or not (`n`, or `F`) the field is required to be present as a header field. The `Y*` signifies that currently, the field is required, but that we envisage it to become optional when tooling becomes more mature, and will be able to automatically create the specified default value. The `F` means that we reserve this field for Future Use.
3. **`Description`** specifies the meaning of the field, and other things you may need to know, e.g. why it is needed, a required syntax, etc.

</details>

| Name       | Req'd | Description |
| ---------- | :---: | :---------- |
| `scopetag`   | Y | [Scopetag](@) of a third-party [scope](@), the [MRG](@) of which contains [MRG entries](@) that have been imported into the [MRG](@). This [scopetag](@) has been chosen by the [curators](@) of the [scope](@) of which the [MRG](@) is part, to refer to that particular third-party [scope](@). This [scopetag](@) may differ from the [scopetag](@) that the [curators](@) of that third-party [scope](@) have chosen for this [scope](@) <br/>Must satisfy regex `[a-z0-9_-]+`. |
| `scopedir`   | Y | URL that locates the [scope directory](@) associated with that third-party [scope](@). |

## MRG Entries {#mrg-entries}

An [MRG](@) consists of a list of [MRG entries](@), the purpose of which is that the various tools can find all data that is relevant for the purpose that such a tool serves.

An [MRG entry](@) has a few fields that are always present, because the [MRGT](@) generates them, as follows:

| Field          | Value(s) that are assigned to the fields |
| -------------- | :---------- |
| `scopetag`     | [Scopetag](@) that [identifies](@) the [scope](@) from within which the contents of the [MRG entry](@) is [curated](@), and obtained. The [`scopes` section](#mrg-scopes) in the [MRG](@) SHOULD contain a mapping between the `scopetag` and its associated [scope directory](@).|
| `locator`      | path, relative to `scopedir`/`curatedir`/, where `scopedir` can be obtained from the `scopes` section of the [MRG](@), and `curatedir` can be obtained from the [SAF](@) that lives in this `scopedir`, where the [curated text](@) lives from which the contents of the [MRG entry](@) was constructed. |
| `navurl`       | path, relative to the URL as specified in the `website` field in the [`scope` section](/docs/tev2/spec-files/saf#terminology) of the [SAF](@) (that lives in the `scopedir` as specified in the `scopes` section of the [MRG](@)), where the rendered version of the [curated text](@) is located. |
| `headingids`   | a list of the [markdown headings](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#headings) and/or [heading ids](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#linking-to-heading-ids) that are found in the [curated text](@). |

An [MRG entry](@) has additional fields that come from the front matter of the [curated text](@) that the [MRG entry](@) represents. Some fields are
- mandatory for all [curated texts](@), and hence will always appear in an [MRG entry](@); these appear in the table below.
- optional for [curated texts](@) - typically, e.g. to accommodate for differences in the types [terminological artifacts](@) that [curated texts](@) document; these also appear in the table below.
- optional in the sense that they are intended to be processed by TEv2 tool plugins - these are not documented here.
- optional in the sense that they are intended to be used by third party rendering tools, such as Docusaurus or Jekyll - these are also not documented here.

:::info Editor's note
We need to think about how to refer readers to sections of plugins and rendering tool documentation that they might want/need to use.
:::

The following table documents the fields that are used within the context of [TEv2](@)

<details>
  <summary>Legend</summary>

1. **`Name`** contains the field name;
2. **`Req'd`** specifies whether (`Y`, or `Y*`) or not (`n`, or `F`) the field is required to be present as a header field. The `Y*` signifies that currently, the field is required, but that we envisage it to become optional when tooling becomes more mature, and will be able to automatically create the specified default value. The `F` means that we reserve this field for Future Use.
3. **`Description`** specifies the meaning of the field, and other things you may need to know, e.g. why it is needed, a required syntax, etc.

</details>

| Name            | Req'd | Description |
| --------------- | :---: | :---------- |
| `vsnTag`          | Y | [Versiontag](@) that [identifies](@) the version of the [terminology](@) from which the contents of the [MRG entry](@) is obtained. If the contents of the [MRG entry](@) was constructed from a [curated text](@), its value equals the value of the `vsntag` field in the [`terminology`-section](#mrg-terminology) of the [MRG](@) that this [MRG entry](@) is a part of. As a result, `scopetag`:`versiontag` [identifies](@) the [terminology](@) from which this [MRG entry](@) has originated.<br/>Must satisfy regex `[a-z0-9_-.]+`.  |
| `term`            | Y | [Term](@) that is used to represent ([identify](@)) a [knowledge artifact](@) in this [scope](@).<br/>Must satisfy regex `[a-z0-9_-]+`. |
| `termType`        | Y | [Text](term-type@) that [identifies](@) the kind of [knowledge artifact](@) that this [MRG entry](@) refers to. Typical values would be `concept`, `relation`, `pattern` (or `mental-model`), `term` (or `alias`), or `usecase`.<br/>Must satisfy regex `[a-z0-9_-]+`. |
| `isa`             | n | [concept](@) of which this is a specialization. |
| `glossaryText`    | Y | Text that is used as the (raw) contents for the entry of this [term](@) in a human readable [glossary](@). Note that this text SHOULD be allowed to contain [term refs](@). |
| `synonymOf`       | n | [term identifier](@) that [identifies](@) the [term](@) of which this is a [synonym](@). |
| `groupTags`       | n | List of [grouptags](@), each of which signifies that the [(scoped) term](@) that this [curated text](@) documents, is part of the group of [terms](@) that it represents.<br/>Example: `[tev2, management]`.<br/>Must satisfy regex [`(?:\[\s*([a-z0-9_-]+)\s*(?:,\s*([a-z0-9_-]+))*\s*\])?`](https://www.debuggex.com/r/a51CXl1NzR3kwihT). |
| `formPhrases`     | n | List of [texts](formphrase@) that are [used to convert](/docs/tev2/spec-tools/trrt#id) the `show text` parts of [term refs](@) into `term`s, for the purpose of accommodating plural forms (for nouns) or conjugate forms (for verbs). For details, see ['Syntax Specs - Form Phrases](/docs/tev2/spec-syntax/form-phrase-syntax). |
| `status`          | n | Text that identifies the status of the term. ([Communities](@) of) [scopes](@) may specify values for this field. An example is the [status tags used by ToIP](https://github.com/trustoverip/concepts-and-terminology-wg/blob/master/docs/status-tags.md). |
| `created`         | n | Date at which of the [curated text](@) was created, in the date format as used within this [scope](@). |
| `updated`         | n | Date at which of the [curated text](@) was last modified, in the date format as used within this [scope](@). |
| `contributors`    | n | Text that shows (or refers to) the people that have contributed to this [curated text](@). |
| `attribution`     | n | Text that credits the original creation of the texts in the document. |
| `originalLicense` | n | Reference to the license of the work from which the texts were derived. |
| `locator`         | n | Text that identifies the file that holds the [curated text](@) of the [knowledge artifact](@) that this [MRG entry](@) describes. The full URL of the [curated text](@) is `scopedir`/`curatedir`/`locator`, where `scopedir` and `curatedir` can be found in the [SAF](@) (which is in the root of `scopedir`). Note that `locator` may contain a path. |
| `navurl`          | n | URL that locates a human readable, rendered version of the [curated text](@) of the [knowledge artifact](@) that this [MRG entry](@) describes. This URL is used to resolve [term refs](@) that refer to this [knowledge artifact](@). |
| `headingIds`      | n | List of texts that can be used as a `trait` in a [term identifier](@), which typically are [markdown 'heading-ids'](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#linking-to-heading-ids). |
